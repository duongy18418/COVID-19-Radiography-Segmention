# COVID-19 Radiography Segmentation

## 1. Project Overview
This project will conduct a performance comparison between the widely used CNN-based image segmentation model, U-Net, and the relatively new Transformer-based model, SegFormer. We aim to identify the best methods for chest radiography segmentation.

## 2. Prerequisite
1. Install [Python 3.11.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3118/)
2. Install Requirements.txt ```pip install -r Requirements.txt```\
   a. If that doesn't work, run ```pip3 install -r Requirements.txt``` instead.
3. Download the [COVID-19 Radiology Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database/data).
4. Navigate to the respective model notebooks and execute them.\
    a. Make sure to change the root directory in Section 1 of each notebook to match the dataset locations on your local machine.
